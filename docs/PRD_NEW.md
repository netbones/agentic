## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
This PRD outlines the requirements for an AI-powered Gmail client hosted on Vercel. The application shall provide users with natural language summaries of their inbox, enable intelligent actions such as responding to emails, clearing clutter, creating meaningful labels, and setting up automations. It shall integrate seamlessly with existing Gmail mailboxes using the Gmail API and Google Cloud Pub/Sub for real-time updates. The client aims to enhance productivity by leveraging AI for summarization and automation, including features like bulk unsubscribe and blocking, while maintaining user control over their data.

### Scope
- **In Scope**:
  - Authentication and management of existing Gmail accounts.
  - Natural language summaries of emails and threads.
  - AI-assisted email responses, clutter clearing, label creation, and automations.
  - Real-time inbox updates via Pub/Sub.
  - Bulk unsubscribe and blocking tools.
  - Automation rules with fields: name, condition, type, action, bool (e.g., enabled/disabled), thread (e.g., apply to threads).
- **Out of Scope**:
  - Support for non-Gmail email providers.
  - Advanced email composition beyond AI-assisted responses (e.g., no rich media editing).
  - On-premises deployment; the app shall be hosted exclusively on Vercel.
  - Data storage beyond what's necessary for automations (e.g., no long-term email archiving outside Gmail).

### Definitions and Acronyms
- **AI**: Artificial Intelligence, used for natural language processing (e.g., summaries, response generation).
- **Gmail API**: Google's RESTful API for accessing and managing Gmail data.
- **Pub/Sub**: Google Cloud Pub/Sub, a messaging service for real-time notifications on Gmail changes.
- **NLP**: Natural Language Processing, for summarizing and understanding email content.
- **Automation**: Custom rules for handling emails, similar to Gmail filters but enhanced with AI.
- **Clutter Clearing**: Automated or manual actions to archive, delete, or label low-priority emails.
- **Bulk Unsubscribe/Blocking**: Tools to unsubscribe from multiple newsletters or block senders in one operation.

### Assumptions and Constraints
- **Assumptions**:
  - Users have existing Gmail accounts and grant OAuth permissions for API access.
  - AI capabilities (e.g., summarization) will leverage external models like Grok or similar, integrated via APIs.
  - Vercel hosting provides serverless scalability for the frontend (e.g., Next.js) and backend functions.
  - Real-time updates require Pub/Sub topics set up per user.
- **Constraints**:
  - Compliance with Google's API terms, including rate limits (e.g., 250 queries per minute per user).
  - No local storage of email content; all data fetched on-demand from Gmail.
  - Privacy: User data not shared without consent; AI processing done securely.
  - Platform: Web-based app, optimized for desktop; mobile responsiveness as a stretch goal.

## 2. User Stories
- As a busy professional, I want natural language summaries of my inbox so that I can quickly understand key emails without reading everything.
- As a user overwhelmed by spam, I want to clear clutter and bulk unsubscribe/block senders so that my inbox stays organized.
- As an email manager, I want to create meaningful labels and automations so that emails are categorized and handled automatically.
- As a responder, I want AI-assisted email responses so that I can reply efficiently using natural language prompts.
- As a real-time user, I want inbox updates via Pub/Sub so that changes (e.g., new emails) are reflected instantly without manual refresh.

## 3. Functional Requirements
The system shall be divided into core modules: Inbox Management, AI Assistance, Automations, and Integrations.

1. **Authentication and Mailbox Management**:
   - The system SHALL authenticate users via OAuth 2.0 with Gmail scopes (e.g., read, modify, labels).
   - The system SHALL allow users to connect and manage multiple existing Gmail mailboxes.

2. **Inbox Summaries and Viewing**:
   - The system SHALL generate natural language summaries for individual emails, threads, or the entire inbox using AI (e.g., "This thread is about your upcoming meeting with Client X; key action: confirm by EOD").
   - The system SHALL display emails in a clean UI, with options to view raw content or AI summaries.

3. **Email Actions**:
   - The system SHALL enable AI-assisted responses (e.g., user inputs "Reply politely declining" and AI generates draft).
   - The system SHALL support basic actions: reply, forward, archive, delete, mark as read/unread.

4. **Clutter Clearing and Bulk Features**:
   - The system SHALL identify clutter (e.g., newsletters, promotions) via AI and allow one-click clearing (archive/delete).
   - The system SHALL provide bulk unsubscribe: Scan inbox for unsubscribe links, execute in batch, and block senders if needed.

5. **Labels and Automations**:
   - The system SHALL allow creation of meaningful labels via AI suggestions (e.g., based on email content).
   - The system SHALL support automations with fields:
     - Name: User-defined string.
     - Condition: Criteria (e.g., sender, keywords, AI-detected sentiment).
     - Type: Filter type (e.g., incoming, existing).
     - Action: Operations (e.g., label, archive, forward).
     - Bool: Enabled/disabled flag.
     - Thread: Apply to entire thread (true/false).
   - Automations SHALL sync with Gmail filters where possible, enhanced by AI.

6. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - The system SHALL use Pub/Sub to watch for inbox changes and push notifications to the client.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
For each requirement, criteria are defined in WHEN-THEN format.

1. **Authentication**:
   - WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth and grant access to specified scopes.
   - WHEN multiple mailboxes are connected THEN the system SHALL allow switching between them seamlessly.

2. **Summaries**:
   - WHEN viewing an email/thread THEN the system SHALL display an AI-generated summary within 5 seconds.
   - WHEN requesting inbox overview THEN the system SHALL summarize top 10 emails by priority (AI-determined).

3. **Actions**:
   - WHEN generating a response THEN the system SHALL create a draft based on user prompt and allow editing before sending.
   - WHEN performing bulk actions THEN the system SHALL process up to 100 emails without errors.

4. **Clutter Clearing**:
   - WHEN scanning for clutter THEN the system SHALL list potential items with unsubscribe links.
   - WHEN executing bulk unsubscribe THEN the system SHALL follow links, confirm unsubscribes, and block senders if selected.

5. **Labels and Automations**:
   - WHEN creating a label THEN the system SHALL suggest names based on email patterns (e.g., "Project X" for related threads).
   - WHEN setting an automation THEN the system SHALL validate fields (e.g., condition not empty) and apply via Gmail API.
   - WHEN Pub/Sub notifies of a change THEN the system SHALL refresh the UI in real-time (e.g., new email appears instantly).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Page loads SHALL occur in under 2 seconds; AI summaries in under 5 seconds. Handle up to 1,000 emails per inbox view.
- **Scalability**: Vercel serverless functions SHALL scale automatically; Pub/Sub for high-volume notifications.
- **Security**: All API calls SHALL use HTTPS; user tokens stored securely (e.g., Vercel KV). Comply with GDPR and Google's data policies.
- **Accessibility**: UI SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support for summaries).
- **Reliability**: System availability SHALL be 99.9%; error handling for API rate limits (e.g., retry with backoff).

## 6. User Interface Considerations
- **Dashboard**: Inbox view with AI summary sidebar; filters for labels/automations.
- **AI Interaction**: Chat-like interface for queries (e.g., "Summarize this thread") and actions (e.g., "Reply to all").
- **Automations UI**: Form-based editor for rules, with previews.
- **Bulk Tools**: Dedicated page for scanning and selecting unsubscribes/blocks.
- **Real-Time**: WebSocket-like updates via Pub/Sub integration.
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js on Vercel for frontend/backend; Tailwind CSS for styling.

## 7. Dependencies and Integrations
- **Gmail API**: For email access, labels, filters.
- **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**: For real-time push notifications (watch inbox changes).
- **AI Services**: Integrate with xAI Grok or similar for NLP summaries and suggestions.
- **Vercel**: Hosting, Edge Functions for API routes, KV for session storage.
- **OAuth Libraries**: NextAuth.js for authentication.

## 8. Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: API rate limits causing delays. **Mitigation**: Implement caching and batching; inform users of limits.
- **Risk**: AI inaccuracies in summaries. **Mitigation**: Allow user feedback to refine models; fallback to raw text.
- **Risk**: Pub/Sub setup complexity per user. **Mitigation**: Automate topic creation on login; handle errors gracefully.
- **Risk**: Privacy concerns with AI processing. **Mitigation**: Process data ephemerally; obtain explicit consent.

## 9. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Cover API integrations (e.g., mock Gmail API calls) and AI functions.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify Pub/Sub notifications and end-to-end flows (e.g., create automation â†’ trigger on new email).
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Simulate real inboxes; test summaries for accuracy.
- **Edge Cases**: Test with large inboxes, invalid automations, failed unsubscribes.
- **Tools**: Jest for unit; Cypress for E2E; reference acceptance criteria for test cases.
